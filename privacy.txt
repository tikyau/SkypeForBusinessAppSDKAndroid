When you redistribute components from this SDK two types of telemetry may be sent from user devices as described in the Skype for Business data collection practices article (https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Skype-for-Business-data-collection-practices-c17e8ea6-b83b-4345-9401-47a6c8b13aad)

1. Census data, which neither the user nor the admin can disable; and 2. Usage data, which the admin can disable. This includes census data generated when unauthenticated guests attempt to join a Skype for Business meeting.  However, no error reporting data or personally identifiable information will be sent.

As a developer leveraging this SDK you may want to communicate this behavior proactively to reduce the chance that someone might raise questions or concerns about this behavior.

When you create an app with this SDK the app ID will be recorded within the app itself, this app ID may be included in the census data.
